# HTML Project Tutorial - Event Page, Tables, and Forms

Welcome to the HTML Project Tutorial repository! This repository contains the starter and final code for two complete projects that will be covered in a YouTube tutorial series. The tutorial series aims to provide comprehensive knowledge about HTML and guide you through building two exciting projects: an Event Page and a project focused on Tables and Forms.

## Project 1: Event Page

In the first project, we will build an Event Page that will cover a wide range of fundamental HTML components. Throughout this project, you will learn how to use the following HTML elements:

- Heading Tags: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
- Paragraph Tags: `<p>`
- Anchor Tags: `<a>`
- Body Tag: `<body>`
- HTML Boilerplate: `<html>`
- Image Tag: `<img>`

By the end of this project, you will have a clear understanding of how to structure basic HTML elements and create an appealing Event Page.

        <h1> Upcoming Events ðŸ“…</h1>
        <h4>Connect, explore, and never miss an event that matches your passion</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>The goal of this event is to provide a seamless and efficient registration process, enabling participants to easily sign up, select sessions, and access all necessary event details. It aims to bring together a diverse group of individuals, offering opportunities for networking, learning, and collaboration. By streamlining the registration process, the event ensures that attendees can focus on making the most of the experience, while fostering a sense of community and knowledge sharing. The focus is on creating an organized, engaging, and impactful event for everyone involved</p>

## Project 2: Tables and Forms

In the second project, we will dive deeper into HTML by focusing on two important components: Tables and Forms. Tables are used to present data in a structured format, while forms are essential for user input and data submission. Throughout this project, you will learn to use the following HTML elements:

- Table Tag: `<table>`
- Table Row Tag: `<tr>`
- Table Header Cell Tag: `<th>`
- Table Data Cell Tag: `<td>`
- Form Tag: `<form>`
- Input Tags: `<input>` (various types), `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<option>`, `<label>`, `<button>`

By the end of this project, you will be proficient in creating tables and forms, and you'll understand how to collect user input and process it.
